# Introduction

Hello, my name is Kit Haywood - I am a Python, Backend and Quantitative Developer specialising in modelling continuous time traded financial instruments. I have 7y of experience developing in Python building a variety of different analysis and full-stack tools. Please see my public repos for examples of some of the code I've written and please get in touch if you would like to see more of my commercially sensitive work. 

I aim to bring a combination of analytical outlooks to any new project: namely -

  - Can existing metrics be built on, tweaked, combined or expedited? 
  - Can new metrics be built from scratch to work in tandem with any in current operation? 
  - Can we reduce noise, randomness, latency or error in results or signals? 
  - Can we reduce risk of loss or failure by running real-world testing in an extensive manner to validate our insights?
  - Will this project be appropriate, robust and accessible to any future developers who might be involved?
